                <h3 class="about-h3">What is Web Design</h3>
                    <p class="about-p">
                        Web design exists for the purpose of websites displayed on the internet. 
                        A web designer works on the appearance, layout, and in some cases, content of a website. 
                        Appearance engages the viewers’ attention, such as, colors being used, fonts, and images. 
                        Layout showcases the content in a structured and organized manner for the users to easily 
                        understand the content. Most websites prefer simplicity so it won’t appear as confusing or 
                        distracting. Web designing includes many different areas like web graphic design, user interface 
                        design, authoring, and including standardized code.

                <h3 class="about-h3">Languages</h3>
                <p class="about-p">
                    Web designing requires numerous techniques in order to assure the best work possible. These techniques 
                    are called ‘languages.’ Different languages contribute to different areas and functions of web designing, 
                    even if they are similar to one another. The languages used for web designing are called ‘frontend languages’ 
                    and include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. ‘Backend languages’ are for programming and scripting. Some backend 
                    languages are Ruby, Python, and Perl. However, we won’t be focusing on backend languages, but more on frontend languages.
